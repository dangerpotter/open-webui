## How to Install 🚀

### Quick Start with Docker 🐳

> [!NOTE]  
> Please note that for certain Docker environments, additional configurations might be needed. If you encounter any connection issues, our detailed guide on [Falcor Documentation](https://docs.Falcor.com/) is ready to assist you.

> [!WARNING]
> When using Docker to install Falcor, make sure to include the `-v Falcor:/app/backend/data` in your Docker command. This step is crucial as it ensures your database is properly mounted and prevents any loss of data.

> [!TIP]  
> If you wish to utilize Falcor with Ollama included or CUDA acceleration, we recommend utilizing our official images tagged with either `:cuda` or `:ollama`. To enable CUDA, you must install the [Nvidia CUDA container toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/nvidia-container-runtime-upgrade/) on your Linux/WSL system.

### Installation with Default Configuration

- **If Ollama is on your computer**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v Falcor:/app/backend/data --name Falcor --restart always ghcr.io/dangerpotter/falcor:main
  ```

- **If Ollama is on a Different Server**, use this command:

  To connect to Ollama on another server, change the `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` to the server's URL:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=https://example.com -v Falcor:/app/backend/data --name Falcor --restart always ghcr.io/dangerpotter/falcor:main
  ```

- **To run Falcor with Nvidia GPU support**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --gpus all --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v Falcor:/app/backend/data --name Falcor --restart always ghcr.io/dangerpotter/falcor:cuda
  ```

### Installation for OpenAI API Usage Only

- **If you're only using OpenAI API**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_secret_key -v Falcor:/app/backend/data --name Falcor --restart always ghcr.io/dangerpotter/falcor:main
  ```

### Installing Falcor with Bundled Ollama Support

This installation method uses a single container image that bundles Falcor with Ollama, allowing for a streamlined setup via a single command. Choose the appropriate command based on your hardware setup:

- **With GPU Support**:
  Utilize GPU resources by running the following command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --gpus=all -v ollama:/root/.ollama -v Falcor:/app/backend/data --name Falcor --restart always ghcr.io/dangerpotter/falcor:ollama
  ```

- **For CPU Only**:
  If you're not using a GPU, use this command instead:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -v ollama:/root/.ollama -v Falcor:/app/backend/data --name Falcor --restart always ghcr.io/dangerpotter/falcor:ollama
  ```

Both commands facilitate a built-in, hassle-free installation of both Falcor and Ollama, ensuring that you can get everything up and running swiftly.

After installation, you can access Falcor at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Enjoy! 😄


#### Falcor: Server Connection Error

If you're experiencing connection issues, it’s often due to the Falcor docker container not being able to reach the Ollama server at 127.0.0.1:11434 (host.docker.internal:11434) inside the container . Use the `--network=host` flag in your docker command to resolve this. Note that the port changes from 3000 to 8080, resulting in the link: `http://localhost:8080`.

**Example Docker Command**:

```bash
docker run -d --network=host -v Falcor:/app/backend/data -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434 --name Falcor --restart always ghcr.io/dangerpotter/falcor:main
```

### Using the Dev Branch 🌙

> [!WARNING]
> The `:dev` branch contains the latest unstable features and changes. Use it at your own risk as it may have bugs or incomplete features.

If you want to try out the latest bleeding-edge features and are okay with occasional instability, you can use the `:dev` tag like this:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -v Falcor:/app/backend/data --name Falcor --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway --restart always ghcr.io/dangerpotter/falcor:dev
```
